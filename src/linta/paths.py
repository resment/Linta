This knowledge base separates human notes, immutable raw sources, AI-compiled

## Directory Roles

- `human/`: personal writing, inbox notes, and drafts.
- `ai_kb/raw/`: immutable source files.
- `ai_kb/wiki/`: compiled knowledge pages.
- `ai_kb/schema/`: maintenance rules for agents.
- `ai_kb/export_for_ai/`: compact context for AI tools.
- `archive/`: archived material.

Review AI-generated diffs before committing changes.

## Rules

- Do not edit, delete, rename, summarize-in-place, or move files under `ai_kb/raw/`.
- Read `ai_kb/schema/AGENTS.md` before maintaining this knowledge base.
- Update `ai_kb/wiki/current_draft/` for proposed current-state changes.
- Do not update `ai_kb/wiki/current/` unless the user explicitly confirms.
- Cite source file paths for important claims.
- Treat `ai_kb/export_for_ai/` as a consumption layer, not the source of truth.

## Directory Roles

- `human/`: user-authored private notes and drafts.
- `ai_kb/raw/`: immutable source of truth.
- `ai_kb/wiki/`: AI-compiled knowledge layer.
- `ai_kb/wiki/source_cards/`: structured summaries for raw sources.
- `ai_kb/wiki/current_draft/`: AI-generated current-state drafts.
- `ai_kb/wiki/current/`: human-confirmed current state.
- `ai_kb/schema/`: rules for agents.
- `ai_kb/export_for_ai/`: compact context for AI tools.

## Immutable Raw Rule

AI must never edit, delete, rename, summarize-in-place, or move files under `ai_kb/raw/`.

## Current State Rule

AI may update `current_draft/`. AI must not update `current/` unless the user explicitly confirms.

## Source Citation Rule

Every important claim in `current/` and `current_draft/` must cite at least one source file path.
